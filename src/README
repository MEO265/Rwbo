`Rwbo` is based on the [Open-WBO](https://github.com/sat-group/open-wbo) an extensible and modular open-source MaxSAT Solver.

The following changes have been made to the original open-wbo code:
- The following optional parts have been removed to reduce size and complexity:
  - Unused solvers: glucose4.0, minisat, minisat2.2, riss
  - Additional materials in folders: tools, test, papers
- Adaptations necessary for CRAN compliance:
    - Adjustments required to compile under Windows:
        - Remove use of `sys/mman.h` in open-wbo
        - Modify `Glucose::realTime()`` to not use `gettimeofday()`
        - Use `putc`instead of `putc_unlocked` (slower but portable)
    - Adjustments required to compile under MacOS:
        - Build without `gmpxx.h`
        - Disable static build if build on MacOS
    - Portability adjustments:
        - Simplified Makefile without use of unix commands
- Adaptations maybe not totally necessary for CRAN compliance but marked by R CMD check as issues:
  - Supress some warnings with "-Wno-class-memaccess" since they are a known part of the bundled code
